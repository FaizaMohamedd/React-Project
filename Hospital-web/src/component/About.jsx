        <p className='text-justify lg:text-start'>SomaliHealthCare Specialist Hospital is a hospital, about which a Somalian mother can, with no trouble and in inner peace, take her baby to the health unit for treatment. This is a service expected and deserved by our Somalian brothers and sisters from the people of the world.
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify lg:text-start'>
          As SomaliHealthCare Association, we set to work with the slogan and principle of “No More Death Rows for Children, No More Death Watch for Mothers”, and built up a Maternity and Children’s Hospital by relying on the power and support received from our philanthropist donators.
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify lg:text-start'>
          By virtue of a bridge of hearts established by the principle of solidarity between refugees and aiders, and with the sense of religious community; SomaliHealthCare Association accepts donations from the philanthropists only to construct a hospital to contribute minimizing maternal and child mortality.
